# Agriculture-Production-Optimization-Engine
An automated agriculture production optimization engine is implemented in this project. The technique uses past crop data, weather trends, and soil properties to forecast the best crop for a certain area. The data is analysed and processed using machine learning algorithms, which produce precise forecasts.
